# LiFi-LightFidelity
Transfer data using light
Imagine a world where every light could connect you to the Internet.
- The spectrum now has to accommodate more mobile users. Connected devices are forecasted increase to 20 Billion IoT devices by the year 2020. 
- Now a days, two new technological terms have evolved which has created a lot of buzz, namely LIFI and IOT.
- LIFI has the prospective to be notably faster than the current wireless fidelity systems and thus can turn everyday led lamps into a wireless internet access points.
- Lights that illuminate our offices, homes, cars and our streets also connecting us to data and powering our growing demand for connectivity.
- The term LiFi was coined by pureLiFi’s CSO, Professor Harald Haas, at a TedGlobal Talk back in 2011 where he demonstrated LiFi for the first time.

# Working Principle
In the field of communication, transmission of data from one place to the other is very important, for which we usually prefer radio waves. However, now a days this usage has increased so tremendously that the integrity and efficiency of the channel has reduced. Moreover the bandwidth occupied by radio waves if also less (in the order of 10^9). This drawback can be overcome by using LIFI. Harald Haas explained that the data could be transmitted via the visible light spectrum or VLS. Its operation is very simple, when the LED is “ON” means logic “1” is transmitted and when LED is “OFF”, logic “0”is transmitted. At the receiver’s end, the photo detector detects this flickering of led and a microchip will convert this optical data into original data. However this happens so fast that it is not visible to the human eye. This technology uses direct modulation without the need for intermediate frequencies (super-heterodyning) as in RF systems.
- Moreover, it uses inexpensive optical components such as LEDs (which can play role of both transmitter and receiver) and photo detectors. It is thus possible to create small, low-complex transceiver units that enable any LED light to act as a high speed data transmitter.
- In order to obtain data rates in the range of hundreds of MBPS we can use array of LEDs which will help us for parallel data transmission or else we can use combination of three basic color LEDs red, green, blue to alter the frequency of light.
